                                            part of the Regulated Qualification Framework (RQF). When calculating TQT, Awarding bodies take into account similar qualifications to ensure that both the quality and the requirement is met. We also consider

                                            follow a unitised structure, GL (hours) will be allocated to the qualification as a whole. We at School of Business London provide well precise and detailed learning materials, prepared by qualified and approved
